# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Internal teams and clients can submit, track, and manage requests through configurable programs with full lifecycle visibility
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation + Authentication (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation + Authentication) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (all plans complete, including gap closure)
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-20 -- Completed 01-04-PLAN.md (client/ scaffolding gap closure -- React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 13%

## Performance Metrics

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-authentication | 4 | 29min | 7.3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (7min), 01-02 (8min), 01-03 (11min), 01-04 (3min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8-phase structure derived from 12 requirement categories with dependency ordering
- Roadmap: n8n integration and notifications combined into single phase (Phase 5) since email notifications require n8n workflows
- Roadmap: Sheet views and request books are separate phases (6 and 7) despite both depending on Phase 3 -- they are distinct user workflows
- Roadmap: Client collaboration is the final phase (8) because it requires programs, requests, real-time, and notifications to all be working
- 01-01: Used tsx watch for dev hot-reload (faster, ESM-compatible, zero-config per STACK.md)
- 01-01: Separate JWT_ACCESS_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET in env validation (per PITFALLS.md)
- 01-01: CORS origin set to validated env.CLIENT_URL for cookie-based auth (not wildcard)
- 01-01: Nginx /api/v1/internal/ block before /api/ rule (per PITFALLS.md Pitfall 2)
- 01-02: Used nanoid@3 (CJS) instead of nanoid@5 (ESM-only) for NodeNext module compatibility
- 01-02: Logout does NOT require authenticate middleware -- identity from refresh token cookie so expired-access-token users can log out
- 01-02: Refresh token bcrypt rounds 10 (vs 12 for passwords) since tokens are already high-entropy
- 01-02: Auth routes mounted directly on app, not apiRouter, for clean /api/v1/auth path
- 01-03: authorize middleware is centralized factory -- no inline role checks anywhere (per PITFALLS.md Pitfall 4)
- 01-03: ProgramMember is separate collection with compound unique index (userId+programId), not embedded
- 01-03: Deactivation is soft delete + all refresh token revocation for immediate session termination
- 01-03: Router-level middleware for authenticate+authorize on all user routes rather than per-route
- 01-04: Used import.meta.url + fileURLToPath instead of __dirname in vite.config.ts (ESM compatibility)
- 01-04: Added @types/node for Node.js path module resolution in Vite config TypeScript

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Package versions in STACK.md are from training data (May 2025 cutoff) -- verify with npm before locking package.json in Phase 1
- Research flag: n8n workflow JSON schema and MongoDB connector behavior need live verification during Phase 5
- Research flag: Request book import wizard UI has no canonical pattern -- may need UX research during Phase 7 planning
