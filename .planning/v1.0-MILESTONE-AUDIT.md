# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0
**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** gaps_found

---

## Executive Summary

Phases 1-4 (Foundation, Programs, Requests, Real-Time) are **complete and verified** with all 37 assigned requirements satisfied and all cross-phase integrations wired. However, **Phases 5-8 are not started** — 29 requirements across n8n Integration, Notifications, Sheet Views, Request Books, and Client Collaboration remain unexecuted.

---

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Verification |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1. Foundation + Authentication | human_needed | 5/5 (code-level) | All 13 requirements satisfied; 5 items need live Docker/HTTP testing |
| 2. Programs + Dynamic Fields | passed | 11/11 | All 6 requirements satisfied |
| 3. Request Lifecycle + Audit | passed | 5/5 | All 14 requirements satisfied |
| 4. Real-Time Events | passed | 9/9 | All 4 requirements satisfied |
| 5. n8n Integration + Notifications | **NOT STARTED** | 0/? | No directory, no plans, no execution |
| 6. Sheet Views | **NOT STARTED** | 0/? | No directory, no plans, no execution |
| 7. Request Books | **NOT STARTED** | 0/? | No directory, no plans, no execution |
| 8. Client Collaboration | **NOT STARTED** | 0/? | No directory, no plans, no execution |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied (37/66)

| Category | Requirements | Phase | All 3 Sources Agree |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| Infrastructure | INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04 | Phase 1 | Yes |
| Authentication | AUTH-01 through AUTH-06 | Phase 1 | Yes |
| User Management | USER-01 through USER-03 | Phase 1 | Yes |
| Programs | PROG-01 through PROG-06 | Phase 2 | Yes |
| Requests | REQ-01 through REQ-11 | Phase 3 | Yes |
| Audit | AUDIT-01 through AUDIT-03 | Phase 3 | Yes |
| Real-Time | RT-01 through RT-04 | Phase 4 | Yes |

### Unsatisfied (29/66) — Phases Not Started

| Category | Requirements | Assigned Phase | Status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| n8n Integration | N8N-01 through N8N-07 (7) | Phase 5 | Not started |
| Notifications | NOTIF-01 through NOTIF-04 (4) | Phase 5 | Not started |
| Sheet Views | SHEET-01 through SHEET-07 (7) | Phase 6 | Not started |
| Request Books | BOOK-01 through BOOK-05 (5) | Phase 7 | Not started |
| Client Collaboration | CLIENT-01 through CLIENT-06 (6) | Phase 8 | Not started |

---

## Cross-Phase Integration (Completed Phases)

**Status:** All wired — 0 broken connections, 0 orphaned exports, 6/6 E2E flows complete

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| User Registration and Login | Complete |
| Protected Resource Access (JWT + RBAC) | Complete |
| Program Creation with Dynamic Fields | Complete |
| Request Lifecycle (Create -> Submit -> Review -> Approve) | Complete |
| Audit Trail Visibility (per-request + admin) | Complete |
| Real-Time Event Delivery (mutation -> Socket.IO -> client) | Complete |

---

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Phase 1 | `paginate()` middleware populates `req.pagination` which is never consumed by any controller | Minor |
| Phase 1-3 | INFRA-03 dual pagination pattern: Phase 1/2 use `paginate()` middleware, Phase 3 uses Zod schema pagination directly. Behavior equivalent but inconsistent. | Minor |

---

## Human Verification Items (Deferred)

Across all 4 completed phases, **14 items** require live runtime testing (Docker, HTTP, MongoDB, WebSocket). These were flagged as `human_needed` or `why_human` in phase verifications. All pass at code/static analysis level.
